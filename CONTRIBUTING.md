This project is a Hobbby project of mine to get further experience in Python, Webhooks and use of third party API to
create a template for Algorithmic Trading.

Anyone may use the template as is, or may make modifications as per their convenience, but I do not take any liability.
This project will not be completed wholly. As in the main strategic algorithm that decides actions will not be included 
and will have to be done by yourself.
